\file SDL_joystick.h

Include file for SDL joystick event handling

The term "device_index" identifies currently plugged in joystick devices between 0 and SDL_NumJoysticks, with the exact joystick
 behind a device_index changing as joysticks are plugged and unplugged.

The term "instance_id" is the current instantiation of a joystick device in the system, if the joystick is removed and then re-inserted
 then it will get a new instance_id, instance_id's are monotonically increasing identifiers of a joystick plugged in.

The term JoystickGUID is a stable 128-bit identifier for a joystick device that does not change over time, it identifies class of
 the device (a X360 wired controller for example). This identifier is platform dependent.

#   with the ::SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK flag.  This causes SDL to scan the system
#   for joysticks, and load appropriate drivers.

#   If you would like to receive joystick updates while the application
#   is in the background, you should set the following hint before calling
